Task 3 – SQL for Data Analysis
Summary:
In this task, I used MySQL to analyze an Ecommerce dataset. I imported the provided SQL file, explored the tables, and wrote different SQL queries to understand the data.

What I Did:
- Imported `ecommerce_dataset.sql` into MySQL Workbench.
- Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY to filter and sort data.
- Performed INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT JOINs to combine tables.
- Used aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX) for analysis.
- Wrote subqueries (e.g., customers who spent above average, products never ordered).
- Created a view (`vw_completed_orders`) to analyze completed orders.
- Added indexes to optimize query performance.
- Captured screenshots of outputs for submission.

Outcome:
I learned how to extract, combine, summarize, and analyze data using SQL, and how views and indexes make analysis easier and faster.
